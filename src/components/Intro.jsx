        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a Software
          Engineer with a passion for programming and staying up-to-date with
          the latest technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy keeping active
          through exercise and spending quality time with friends at local
          breweries, I believe life is all about balance. I'm always seeking
          opportunities for growth and development as a Software Engineer, and I
          strive to be part of a company that supports and challenges me in this
          pursuit.
