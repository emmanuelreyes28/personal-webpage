# Emmanuel's Website/Portfolio

Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS

Source code for https://emmanuelreyes.dev/

First time using a Tailwind CSS and it was a pleasurable experience!
Being able to see both the content and style for components made making CSS changes fast and easy! Personalizing configurations is also really easy to do.
